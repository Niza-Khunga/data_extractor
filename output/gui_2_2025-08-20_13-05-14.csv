Main Topic: Introduction to Data Mining and Warehousing 
Learning Objectives 
By the end of this week, you should be able to: 
• Define Data Mining (DM) and Data Warehousing (DW) and differentiate them 
• Understand the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process 
• Identify major applications of DM and DW in real-world domains 
• Recognize key ethical issues (privacy, bias, transparency, GDPR)

Core Concepts to Master 
1. What is Data Mining (DM)? 
Definition: 
Data Mining is the process of discovering meaningful patterns, trends, correlations, and anomalies 
from large datasets using techniques from machine learning, statistics, and database systems. 
Key Features: 
• Focuses on knowledge extraction from data 
• Involves methods like classification, clustering, association rules 
• Applied in fraud detection, marketing, medicine, and more 
2. What is Data Warehousing (DW)? 
Definition: 
A Data Warehouse is a centralized repository that stores historical and current data from multiple 
sources in a structured format for analysis and reporting. 
Key Components: 
• ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) 
• OLAP cubes for multidimensional analysis 
• Star and snowflake schemas for modeling 
3. Differences: DM vs DW 
Feature 
Purpose 
Data Mining 
Data Warehousing 
Pattern discovery, prediction Data consolidation, reporting 
Techniques Used Machine learning, statistics ETL, OLAP, dimensional modeling 
Output 
Models, rules, patterns 
Time Orientation Often predictive 
Structured historical data 
Historical and current 
4. KDD Process (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) 
A structured approach to data mining that includes: 
1. Selection – Choosing relevant data 
2. Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing data 
3. Transformation – Feature engineering, dimensionality reduction 
4. Data Mining – Applying algorithms 
5. Interpretation/Evaluation – Assessing and visualizing results 
Think of DM as the core step within the broader KDD pipeline. 
5. Applications of DM & DW 
• E-commerce: Recommendation systems, customer segmentation 
• Healthcare: Disease prediction, patient history analysis 
• Finance: Credit scoring, fraud detection 
• Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance 
Case Study: Amazon uses DM to recommend products based on purchase patterns and DW to 
store customer histories and transactions. 
6. Ethical Considerations in Data Mining 
• Bias in Models: Models trained on biased data can reinforce discrimination. 
• Privacy: Sensitive personal data must be protected. 
• Transparency: Users should understand how decisions are made. 
• Regulations: 
o GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): EU law for data protection 
o IEEE/ACM AI Ethics: Fairness, accountability, and explainability 
Ethical data mining respects individual privacy, ensures fairness, and avoids discriminatory 
outcomes. 
Lab & Practice Exercises 
Task 1: Concept Summary 
Write a 1-page comparison between Data Mining and Data Warehousing. Include: 
• Definitions 
• Key differences 
• One example for each 
Task 2: Case Study Research 
Choose one application area (e.g., healthcare). Find a real case where data mining or warehousing 
was used. Answer: 
• What data was used? 
• What problem was solved? 
• What techniques were applied? 
Task 3: KDD Diagram 
Draw the KDD process stages with labels and a brief explanation for each step. 
 
      Tools for This Week 
• Reading Support: Use ChatGPT or Perplexity.ai for explanations 
• Drawing: Lucidchart / Draw.io for KDD diagrams 
• Notes: Use Notion, OneNote, or physical notebook for topic summaries 
 
          Review Questions 
1. What are the main differences between DM and DW? 
2. Describe the stages in the KDD process. 
3. Why is data preprocessing necessary before mining? 
4. Identify two ethical issues in data mining and how to mitigate them. 
5. How does GDPR affect data mining practices?
