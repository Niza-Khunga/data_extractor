1,"Week 1: July 22 – July 28 
Main Topic: Introduction to Data Mining and Warehousing 
Learning Objectives 
By the end of this week, you should be able to: 
• Define Data Mining (DM) and Data Warehousing (DW) and differentiate them 
• Understand the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process 
• Identify major applications of DM and DW in real-world domains 
• Recognize key ethical issues (privacy, bias, transparency, GDPR)
