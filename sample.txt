CSC 4792 Week 3 Summary & Core Concepts: Tools, Technologies & Dimensionality
 Reduction
 1. Fundamental Tools & Environments - Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment combining
 Markdown, executable code, equations, and visualizations. - Google Colaboratory (Colab): Cloud-based
 Jupyter environment with free GPU/TPU access, pre-installed libraries, and easy sharing.
 2. Datasets Used - Predicting Student Learning Outcomes dataset - UNZA Institutional Repository Research
 Output dataset
 3. Core Python Libraries - Pandas: Data manipulation with DataFrames and Series. - Matplotlib:
 Visualizations (bar, line, histogram, scatter). - Scikit-learn: Machine learning and preprocessing tools,
 including PCA and LDA.
 4. 
Data Exploration & Visualization 
(.head(), 
.info() , - 
Pandas 
for 
loading, 
inspecting
 .describe() ), filtering, and transforming data. - Matplotlib for visual summaries
 of datasets.
 Dimensionality Reduction Fundamentals
 What is Dimensionality Reduction? The process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while
 retaining important information. It helps to: - Solve the curse of dimensionality - Improve model efficiency
 and generalization - Reduce storage needs - Enable easier visualization
 Feature Selection: - Selects a subset of original features without changing them. - Techniques: - Filter
 Methods: Statistical tests (correlation, Chi-square) - Wrapper Methods: Model-based evaluation (Recursive
 Feature Elimination) - Embedded Methods: Selection during training (Lasso regression)
 Feature Extraction: - Transforms original features into new features (components). - PCA: Unsupervised
 method finding components that explain most variance. - LDA: Supervised method maximizing class
 separability.
 PCA Process: 1. Standardize data 2. Compute covariance matrix 3. Calculate eigenvectors & eigenvalues 4.
 Select top-k components
 LDA Difference: - Considers class labels when finding new axes, unlike PCA.
 5. Key Code Concepts - Pandas for filtering and transformations. - Matplotlib for visualizations. - Scikit-learn
 for implementing PCA and LDA.

Takeaway: Week 3 strengthens both practical tool usage (Jupyter, Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib) and theoretical
 understanding of dimensionality reduction, equipping you to process high-dimensional data efficiently and
 effectively.
