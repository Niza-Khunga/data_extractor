## Environment Setup

1. **Install Python**
   - Recommended: **Python 3.11**
   - Download: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```
   python -m venv venv

**Activate virtual environment:**

Windows (PowerShell):

```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Windows (Command Prompt):
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Linux/macOS:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required Python packages
```
pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests python-docx pdfplumber tabulate openpyxl lxml
```

**Tip:** Always activate the virtual environment before running the program to ensure dependencies are loaded correctly.

beautifulsoup4 â†’ For parsing web pages

requests â†’ For fetching URL content

python-docx â†’ For reading DOCX files

pdfplumber â†’ For extracting PDF text

tabulate â†’ For displaying terminal tables

openpyxl â†’ For Excel file handling

lxml â†’ HTML/XML parsing

## Usage

Place files to extract in the input/ folder (optional if using full paths).

**Run the program:**
```
python data_extractor.py
```

**Follow the terminal prompts:**

## Navigation Commands

During prompts, you can use the following commands:

**Command	Description**
exit	    Exit the program immediately
redo	    Repeat the current stage without going back
return	  Go back to the previous stage
restart	  Go back to the "choose source" stage
Notes

## Ensure the input/ folder exists and contains files if using the folder search options.

Outputs are saved in output/ folder with timestamped filenames to prevent overwriting.

Invalid inputs will prompt re-entry or navigation commands.

Structured output includes additional attributes for easier analysis and data processing.
