# Data Extraction Tool

This is a Python-based Data Extraction Tool that allows users to extract text data from various sources, including PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, Excel files, and URLs. The program supports extracting words, sentences, or paragraphs and outputs structured results to terminal, CSV, or Excel with extended attributes and optional previews. A GUI version provides an interactive interface for users who prefer not to use the terminal.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Python

- Recommended: Python 3.11
- Download: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows Command Prompt
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Python Packages

The project includes a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary dependencies for both the terminal and GUI versions.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This ensures that anyone cloning the repository can quickly set up the correct environment.

2. Follow the interactive prompts:

   - Choose source: File (from `input/` folder or browse) or URL
   - Select extraction type: word, sentence, paragraph
   - Preview results in a scrollable table with structured columns:

     - ID
     - Extracted Data
     - Type
     - Length
     - Preview (first 50 characters)

   - Save results automatically with timestamped filenames:
